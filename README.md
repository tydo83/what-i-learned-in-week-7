# What I learned in week 7.

## Location of ! (Bang)
When it is not used with == operator, it is located in the front of the statement.
```
if(!language in db)
// if language is not in our date base
```
---
## Trim method 
Remove white space around string, not the middle space though

---
## Function parameter
In JavaScript, you can pass the function as a parameter

---
## Map and filter helper function
```
variable.filter(function) 
// return transformed elements

variable.map(function) 
// return boolean value to filter elements
```
---
## When we passed elements to function.
this is what actually happens
```
func(element, i, arr)
/// if you have to use an index, you don't have to declare it
/// since it is already passed
```
---
### Other way to build a reversed string
```
split.reverse.join
```
